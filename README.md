# üìò Mastering Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) with Physics-Based Examples

Welcome to **fno-physics-tutorials** ‚Äî a curated collection of Jupyter notebooks designed to help you master **Fourier Neural Operators (FNO)** through progressive, hands-on, and physics-inspired learning.

FNOs are a cutting-edge deep learning architecture capable of learning mappings between infinite-dimensional function spaces, making them ideal for solving partial differential equations (PDEs) efficiently and with high generalization.
